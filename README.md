### Frontend

- **Framework:** React
  _Reason:_ React provides a robust foundation for building responsive and interactive web applications with a wide ecosystem of libraries and tools.

- **UI Library:** Vanilla styling
  _Reason:_ Lightweight and flexible styling options allow for precise control over component rendering and responsiveness.

- **State Management:** React's built-in tools
  _Reason:_ Ideal for managing state in small to medium apps. If state complexity grows, Zustand can be considered due to its minimal API and performance advantages.

- **Audio Input Support:**

  - **Audio Capture:** Web Speech API or third-party browser-compatible libraries.
  - **Speech-to-Text:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to convert audio to text.
  - **Text Processing:** Send the transcribed text to the ChatGPT API (starting with GPT-3.5 Turbo for cost-effectiveness, with the option to switch to GPT-4 if needed).
  - **JSON Structuring:** ChatGPT interprets the text and structures it into a JSON object.
  - **User Confirmation:** The structured data is returned to the user for confirmation and manual alterations if necessary.

- **File Storage:** Integration with cloud services (e.g., AWS S3 or browser-compatible alternatives) to allow users to upload and store medical documents like test results.

- **Notifications (Optional):**
  - **Browser Notifications:** Use browser push APIs or tools like OneSignal for sending notifications.
